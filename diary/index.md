## 07/09/20 09:19 to 09:49, Upgrading +EQT emails 
So right now I can send mail (to gmail) from joe@equalitytime.co.uk from G-suite -but the autoresponder goes to joeequalitytime@gmail (which should happen) 

However, the email "Test Monday" to joe@www goes to joeeqaulity@gmail which is not what I want and might be some problem with DNS propergation. 

## 07/09/20 09:49 to 10:03, +EQT
* I had planned to only move the www email accounts, but I've actually moved the eqt ones as well because I'd already created some eqt ones in Gsuite. 

## 07/09/20 10:03 to 10:39, +EQT
I've started the process of pointing the DNS records at the github pages site. It's sort of working, but there's a problem with the css?

## 08/09/20 07:50 to 08:02,  Drawing. 
## 08/09/20 08:03 to 08:53, Doing notes. +EQT
* Also working out some next steps, as always
* Also wrote the webmasters question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/131325/14932 

## 08/09/20 09:12 to 09:20, More fixing notes, more getting on top of everything. +EQT
I like that this way of doing notes is working better. Like, there's a lot of work that happens when processing the notes and it's worth doing, particularly in concert with the internet files. 

## 08/09/20 09:21 to 09:33, Thinking about good ways of using log files

## 08/09/20 09:48 to 10:10, +EQT Timesheet broken

## 08/09/20 10:38 to 10:48, +EQT fixing WWW site 

## 09/09/20 07:23 to 07:38, Writing up notes 
Notes on notes: 
* I'm NOT taking enought. 

## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
* I want A place for them to be stored (that is backed up) 
* I want to write them locally first and then work up. 
* I'm tired. 
* Today I have to do the actual THINGs I'm meant to be doing. 
* But first, let me actually fix the THING.  

So where to put this? 
* It's one big file. I'd like to have it under version control MAYBE? Or MAYBE simply occsaionally backed up. It probably has to live on the server for the timesheet STUFF to work... 
* I could simply paste it into the timesheet... 
* I want it public because that's what I want. 
* It's effectively a weblog, so it goes on the personal site. That's the backup.   


## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
I've put the main log file in the blog for now. 
...and While I'm here, I'll treat myself to moving a post. 

## 09/09/20 07:56, So what's the next THING on the list. 
* Ah, a problem with doing it locally is that I don't have an easy way to reach the todo list. Let's see how we do.  

## 09/09/20 08:09 to 08:12, https://github.com/eQualityTime/Home/issues/105 
Sorting out minutes first 

## 09/09/20 08:46 to 09:18, Fixing minutes +EQT


## 10/09/20 07:07 to 07:50, Starting with Google analytics  
* Notes: Twitter isn't that healthy, particularly in terms of - unit-per-post. 
* fb is driving most of my links, despitre the fact that I hardly ever post links there. 
* Linkedin is doing suprisingly well, worth keeping going on that. 
* YouTube has it's own analtics, but it turns out you can put a GA code in there. 
* I haven't properly set up the analtics for the new WWW site. 

## 10/09/20 07:52 to 07:56, Writing up notes 

## 10/09/20 07:56 to 09:35, Email +EQT
* I've imported signitures and such. I will, in the future, work out mirgrating emails and contacts 
* I've imported contacts 
* I'm looking at importing all mail. 
  * I think I have to wait 24 hours for mail import.
* I have one email to write. 

## 10/09/20 10:20 to 10:30, +EQT
* I have two emails to write. 
  * One to the prison. Done
- 10/09/20 smallest next step:  I literally  have to read an email. 

Okay, the issue is that the SK and bg files don't convert well with OBF. I'd better convert them and see what happens. 


## 11/09/20 07:00 to 10:36, Working on WWW website 
* Wrote up the article 
* Spent a lot of time getting the allbooksever.csv right. 
* Fixed the jekyll issues 

Things left to do: 

* Odre the covers. 
* Push to server 
* Write blog post. 


## 11/09/20 19:48 to 20:16,  Photo editing. 
There where literally none I liked. 
* There is a ongoing problem with taking photos facing the sun. Lots of shady photos and overexposed backgrounds. 

## 12/09/20 17:10, What do I want for the office? 

* Another monitor (that's always what I want) 
* A better way of dealing with full screen STUFF.  
* A place for the water butt hat I can reach. 
* A 'outbox' 
* Clear out a few drawers. 
* A big TV for 'adult rec room'. 
* Place for brainstorming - big workspace. 
* The mac mini put up. 


What do I want 'to hand'?

* Taking a moment for the Joka reminders.


## 13/09/20 15:52 to 16:20, Logged into public 
* doing the admin of a new operating system
* This site https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubegaming/comments/64lprh/creating_stream_highlights_after_stream_ends/ has it that I can easily extract highlights from youtube while leaving the origianl video. Let's have a look. 
* Interestingly, you can't make changes for a few hours after you have, say, clipped a few seconds off the front. Does that mean that it's hard to take multiple highlights from one stream? 
* I haven't worked out highlights yet, but I did manage a tweet. 
* I've labeled a few streams 
* I've found the 'save as new' option, but it's a bit scary to use. I can imagine it being a problem. 
* Having reviewed a couple of streams, I think you have to think in terms of individual separate tasks and break them down. 

## 13/09/20 16:31 to 16:37,  Clearing out the filespace 
* Included commiting the memory book, but not pushing it before delete. Sigh. My own fault, obviously
* Now what? Check out the todo list? Crazy talk  
* Crap, the todo list is totally out of date. I've been not on top of things at all.

## 19/09/20 06:10 to 06:24, Reviewing presentations 
* Decided that they should be in a public dropbox folder because that's easist to edit later 
* Found at that most of them aren't interesting to look at.  

## 19/09/20 06:24 to 06:46, I'm working on updating my parlimentary tracker 
It's not been working for a while, and it turns out that's because my clever 'I'll get the data from everypolition, was a poor shout'. 

I've setup a new list of mps names, but now I have to read it. and I'd like to do some proper python testing while I'm there. 

## 19/09/20 08:20 to 09:08, More on Mps

## 21/09/20 07:38 to 09:50, Really attacked the personal todo list
I started with 34 items, but got to about 25. Included some DIY, phone calls, weeding out some doubles, that sort of thing. Was worthwhile.  Included reviewing my feedly feeds which was _just better_ than getting information from social media. 

## 21/09/20 10:01 to 10:18, Small baby break

## 09/11/20 19:55 to 20:05, Todo list rewrite. 
I'm working on the todo list - I've removed all the priorities, times and contexts and I'm rewriting them anew. It's a bit of a displacement activity, but it's helping me gain some clarity. 

* My first sticking point is 'work on carestar', but I'm a bit 'over' reaching out for the moment. 

## 09/11/20 20:21 to 20:48, Working on Vision. 
I'm getting vision to distinguish between public and private projects. I didn't complete the work because I decided after a while that it wasn't worth the effort, but I did add a small bit of functionality. 

## 09/11/20 20:53 to 21:04, Back to todo list rewrite. 
Completed, down to 17 items. Nice. Time for a break
