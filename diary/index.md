Excellent git diagram here: http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/git-pretty.png 

## 03/03/20 14:41 to 17:05, Working on WWW site.  +EQT

## 10/03/20 05:45 to 07:21, Working on memory book

## 10/03/20 14:15 to 15:53, Working on memory book 

## 11/03/20 06:26 to 08:44, Working on memory book. 
I've got 53 pages (75 sized for 6 by 9). There's going to be maybe five pages of diagrams, and another page of references. How much more have I got to write?      

Chapters
* Completely restructure the opening chapter, cut it down and make it reasonable. 
  * Do the list of what we want people to know and understand in the first chapter 
* The types chapter is acutally reasonable okay, might put more in as it grows, but otherwise happy to leave it for now until polish.   
* Linked list needs properly writing. There's nothing there 
* Arrays also isn't done. The structure exists but it's just chat.  
* Classes needs reformatting: a way of properly refering to classes and to have also really worked out a nice way of separating the image from the explanation 
* Trees needs some editing and the images, but the material is mostly there. I feel like it would benefit from some exercises. 

In general: 
* Look for definitions and key words: link, mnemonic and put them into the text 
  * As part of this work out how we refer to the process 'lock in' a memory??  
  * Rewrite the opennings to all chapters and start again. 



## 15/03/20 08:17 
I want to have 30,000 words at peak so I can edit down.  That looks like being a reasonable thing.    

Ways of increasing the page count: 

* Diagrams, a diagram for every image/link we have  
* Exercises -  a page of exercises at the end of every chapter 
* Introductions and conclusions "This chapter will, this chapter has"  
* Lists of examples 
* Pithy quotes form other people about usefulness 
* Put all the rubbish in the appendixes 

## 15/03/20 08:20 
One of the things that will help will be finding a nice way of typesetting the difference between images and the things they refer to.   


## 17/03/20 06:32 to 08:05, Working on memory book:

## 07/09/20 09:19 to 09:49, Upgrading +EQT emails 
So right now I can send mail (to gmail) from joe@equalitytime.co.uk from G-suite -but the autoresponder goes to joeequalitytime@gmail (which should happen) 

However, the email "Test Monday" to joe@www goes to joeeqaulity@gmail which is not what I want and might be some problem with DNS propergation. 

## 07/09/20 09:49 to 10:03, +EQT
* I had planned to only move the www email accounts, but I've actually moved the eqt ones as well because I'd already created some eqt ones in Gsuite. 

## 07/09/20 10:03 to 10:39, +EQT
I've started the process of pointing the DNS records at the github pages site. It's sort of working, but there's a problem with the css?

## 08/09/20 07:50 to 08:02,  Drawing. 
## 08/09/20 08:03 to 08:53, Doing notes. +EQT
* Also working out some next steps, as always
* Also wrote the webmasters question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/131325/14932 

## 08/09/20 09:12 to 09:20, More fixing notes, more getting on top of everything. +EQT
I like that this way of doing notes is working better. Like, there's a lot of work that happens when processing the notes and it's worth doing, particularly in concert with the internet files. 

## 08/09/20 09:21 to 09:33, Thinking about good ways of using log files

## 08/09/20 09:48 to 10:10, +EQT Timesheet broken

## 08/09/20 10:38 to 10:48, +EQT fixing WWW site 

## 09/09/20 07:23 to 07:38, Writing up notes 
Notes on notes: 
* I'm NOT taking enought. 

## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
* I want A place for them to be stored (that is backed up) 
* I want to write them locally first and then work up. 
* I'm tired. 
* Today I have to do the actual THINGs I'm meant to be doing. 
* But first, let me actually fix the THING.  

So where to put this? 
* It's one big file. I'd like to have it under version control MAYBE? Or MAYBE simply occsaionally backed up. It probably has to live on the server for the timesheet STUFF to work... 
* I could simply paste it into the timesheet... 
* I want it public because that's what I want. 
* It's effectively a weblog, so it goes on the personal site. That's the backup.   


## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
I've put the main log file in the blog for now. 
...and While I'm here, I'll treat myself to moving a post. 

## 09/09/20 07:56, So what's the next THING on the list. 
* Ah, a problem with doing it locally is that I don't have an easy way to reach the todo list. Let's see how we do.  

## 09/09/20 08:09 to 08:12, https://github.com/eQualityTime/Home/issues/105 
Sorting out minutes first 

## 09/09/20 08:46 to 09:18, Fixing minutes +EQT


## 10/09/20 07:07 to 07:50, Starting with Google analytics  
* Notes: Twitter isn't that healthy, particularly in terms of - unit-per-post. 
* fb is driving most of my links, despitre the fact that I hardly ever post links there. 
* Linkedin is doing suprisingly well, worth keeping going on that. 
* YouTube has it's own analtics, but it turns out you can put a GA code in there. 
* I haven't properly set up the analtics for the new WWW site. 

## 10/09/20 07:52 to 07:56, Writing up notes 

## 10/09/20 07:56 to 09:35, Email +EQT
* I've imported signitures and such. I will, in the future, work out mirgrating emails and contacts 
* I've imported contacts 
* I'm looking at importing all mail. 
  * I think I have to wait 24 hours for mail import.
* I have one email to write. 

## 10/09/20 10:20 to 10:30, +EQT
* I have two emails to write. 
  * One to the prison. Done
- 10/09/20 smallest next step:  I literally  have to read an email. 

Okay, the issue is that the SK and bg files don't convert well with OBF. I'd better convert them and see what happens. 


## 11/09/20 07:00 to 10:36, Working on WWW website 
* Wrote up the article 
* Spent a lot of time getting the allbooksever.csv right. 
* Fixed the jekyll issues 

Things left to do: 

* Odre the covers. 
* Push to server 
* Write blog post. 


## 11/09/20 19:48 to 20:16,  Photo editing. 
There where literally none I liked. 
* There is a ongoing problem with taking photos facing the sun. Lots of shady photos and overexposed backgrounds. 

## 12/09/20 17:10, What do I want for the office? 

* Another monitor (that's always what I want) 
* A better way of dealing with full screen STUFF.  
* A place for the water butt hat I can reach. 
* A 'outbox' 
* Clear out a few drawers. 
* A big TV for 'adult rec room'. 
* Place for brainstorming - big workspace. 
* The mac mini put up. 


What do I want 'to hand'?

* Taking a moment for the Joka reminders.


## 13/09/20 15:52 to 16:20, Logged into public 
* doing the admin of a new operating system
* This site https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubegaming/comments/64lprh/creating_stream_highlights_after_stream_ends/ has it that I can easily extract highlights from youtube while leaving the origianl video. Let's have a look. 
* Interestingly, you can't make changes for a few hours after you have, say, clipped a few seconds off the front. Does that mean that it's hard to take multiple highlights from one stream? 
* I haven't worked out highlights yet, but I did manage a tweet. 
* I've labeled a few streams 
* I've found the 'save as new' option, but it's a bit scary to use. I can imagine it being a problem. 
* Having reviewed a couple of streams, I think you have to think in terms of individual separate tasks and break them down. 

## 13/09/20 16:31 to 16:37,  Clearing out the filespace 
* Included commiting the memory book, but not pushing it before delete. Sigh. My own fault, obviously
* Now what? Check out the todo list? Crazy talk  
* Crap, the todo list is totally out of date. I've been not on top of things at all. 


## 13/09/20 16:42 to 16:50, Working on todos

## 19/09/20 06:10 to 06:24, Reviewing presentations 
* Decided that they should be in a public dropbox folder because that's easist to edit later 
* Found at that most of them aren't interesting to look at.  

## 19/09/20 06:24 to 06:46, I'm working on updating my parlimentary tracker 
It's not been working for a while, and it turns out that's because my clever 'I'll get the data from everypolition, was a poor shout'. 

I've setup a new list of mps names, but now I have to read it. and I'd like to do some proper python testing while I'm there. 

## 19/09/20 08:20 to 09:08, More on Mps

I started with 34 items, but got to about 25. Included some DIY, phone calls, weeding out some doubles, that sort of thing. Was worthwhile.  Included reviewing my feedly feeds which was _just better_ than getting information from social media.

## 09/11/20 20:21 to 20:48, Working on Vision.

## 15/11/20 07:44 to 08:45, Doing cookery course. 
* Baking soda - if you have 'too much' baking soda to react with the acid, it's probably there to increase browning. 
* Sous vide doens't only cook meat precisely - it's got a characteristic 'edge to edge is the same level of done' rather than '25% of your stake is more done that one want it' 
* The old CTO of microsoft is really interesting. 
* Heat diffiusion constants all turn out to be between like 1.2 and 1.8, and that turns out to be because water has a constant of 1.4 so the L=root(4dt)=root(5.6t) is a good aproximation 
* Rule of thumb - 4 minutes to go one cm.  Now, if you have a six cm baked potatoe, then you  need, 16 minutes for two, and then an hour for four cm. 
* It would be interesting to compare with the set heating times for oven THINGs

Wasted a lot of time on it. 

## 17/12/20 10:56, Let's think about cookery processes. 
If I want to document cookery experiments then I also want to write them up. But, they are likely to be very multimedia, very link based, and should b e done reflectively.  That says blog to me. It also means  Ishould practice my food photography. 


## 18/12/20 09:18 to 09:23, Setting up email properly on Thunderbird.

  * To the extent that they are edits to the blog, because they should be written properly. 
* I'm going to do a proper example now. 

## 18/12/20 11:09 to 11:30, Working on Sibs draft. 
This is quite hard, and they've written it in a much less positive way than I would phrase it. It's also directly linked to me as a person.  I have spoken to mum and shared it with her to check that she is okay with the general tone.

* I reconciled up to 31/10/2020 on 10/11/2020 
* That was the last date I uploaded any files according to the audit log. 
* The way I checked that I wouldn't import transactions multiple times was that I started the reconciliation and checked if any transactions turned up (this is probably good practice anyway. 
* I've reconcilled now. 
* Finding out how to sort bills. 
* Okay let me explain this. 

Okay Joe, next time you reconcile an account here's how you do it. 

* Get the paper copy. 
* Optional - tick off the bills (on paper) that should have been paid
* Start the reconciliation (it will fail), putting in the end date and ending balance.* If there are any transactions to sort out, they should appear, but in general, there shouldn't be any tranactions to reconcile. 
* Download the month's figures from Unity and import. Remember to select format before the statment name
* As you import, tick off the amounts on the bank statement. Make sure that anything that should be a bill, is matched to one. 
* IMPORTANT - double check the bills list and make sure the right THINGs have gone out.
* Complete reconciliation. 

I've added these instructions to the calendar

* We have showing of an image, 
* We're currently installing the screenshot library (took ages) 
* I don't know if we'll ever have a system shortcut

## 23/12/20 20:10 to 20:59, Working on Mouse-Sniper
* While writing a Stack Overflow question I fixed the issue :)

* Lots of rewriting 
* Put it at https://github.com/joereddington/Mouse-Sniper/tree/main and the next action is to write the blog 


## 24/12/20 13:20 to 13:30, Working on Mouse Sniper 

For my own personal amusement I try to use the mouse as little as possible during the working day.  You could, I suppose, make the argument that it's more efficient to do everything by keyboard shortcut, and I suppose it is, but it's far less of an efficiency gain than a hundred other things I could do. 

I approach this quite sportingly. I use [whatpulse](XXX) to keep track of the ratio of keystokes to mouseclicks over time, and spend a certain amount of fascinated time looking up obscure shortcut keys of all types.  

Professionally, I do also have a general interest in keyboard control of devices from a accessibility perspective, but I should be clear that my main motivation is a general playfulness (I won't deny that it's useful to have a good working knowledge of what sites and organisations are good for accessibility, and it feels good to support them) 
With this motivation, I'm put together a short Python script recently that lets me quickly arrange mouse clicks via the keyboard.  It was a nice little project for the Christmas break.   

## 25/12/20 11:09, (and various other times) Working on Mouse Sniper 
* Got the cropping working so it's a bit faster

* Also changing nappies, that sort of thing
* Blog written up here:  http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/12/26/mouse-sniper.html 

## 26/12/20 20:10 to 22:05, Working on Mouse-sniper
* I think the solution to a hotkey is to use automator, which is a shame for sharing, but still quite fun. 


## 27/12/20 07:54, Hmm, the whatpulse thing is slighlty annoying, The loca 
The logical solution is to add a count in my mouse snipe, but that feels like a lot of work for software I'd like to be more broadly used. 

It's also far too early to put it in - as it gets easier to use, it will get used more, and once it's at the point of being used properly then it will start aquiring click

## 29/12/20 06:20 to 06:44, stopped to work out the vim dictionary locations 


## 29/12/20 06:38, Dragging is going to be hard with the mouse sniper, unless I `store` the first click and then have it execute slowly. 
* That does actually sound like a solution



## 29/12/20 09:01 to 10:28, Doing simplewriter on book

## 29/12/20 10:28, P20 I have reached 'contributions' - that's actually a solid 90 minutes, time to do something else.  

## 29/12/20 10:34, Okay, I'm looking at my list.  I've onde at least the firsto ne.

Alright people, let's do this one last time. My name is Joe Reddington. I was a postdoc and then I was bitten by a radioactive nonprofit. And for the last seven years I've been running the one and only eQuality Time. 

I'm pretty sure you know the rest.  You see I won some grants, lost a lot more, fell in love, worked with a lot of schools, MAYBE too many. Wrote code, worked with researchers, worked without researchers. Made art. Tried therapy, started massively oversharing, had kids, found out about the lockdown while in literal prison FFS, and waved goodbye to our income for 2020, I'm now finding a way back.

Seems fair.  

## 18/01/21 09:19, The main question is: where did I get to? 

## 18/01/21 09:21 to 09:40, Hey, you know what, I really want to have a version of simplewriter for vim, which is surely achieveable by switching the dictionary locaiton...

* Added a citation when I borrowed a line, that's probably overkill. 
* Got to line 381, feels like I'm really slow. But made it to the second chapter at least  
* I'm thinking that I shouldn't simplify the language in the imagry, but I should simplify the structure

Sent the email - the numbers turned out to be a pain.

## 25/01/21 07:15, 
The next THING to do with Mousesniper is to get it to do drags. So I want a system where I store a click, and then hold it down. 

Add a keybinding (I like times) that flipped a boolean and stored an x/y
Change the click so that they check the boolean (and slowly move) 

## 25/01/21 08:34 to 08:39, Doing some light email +EQT 

## 25/01/21 09:10 to 09:42, Learning about vimdiff
What did I learn? 

That using vimdiff in git with the command 'git mergetool' opens four  windows, and the easiest way to process is to close the middle one and concentrate on getting the top two in sync. 

If there is a time the top two aren't in sync, check it with the bottom one .

Also, I'd really really like to be able to sort entires by time. 






## 25/01/21 10:05 to 10:08, Checking sitemap on joereddington.github.com
There was a problem that the sitemap was only using 'example.com' generated urls. 
I've fixed it and put in a new version. 
It took six days to read the sitemap, so I'm going to put in a note to check next Tuesday 


## 25/01/21 11:08 to 11:58, Meeting and updating tracking code +EQT
Nice chat and then spent some time adding conversion code to the website - I choose emails as a conversion metric, but I should probably have chosen 'contact us' as an option. 

Later edit: conversion code did actually work

## 26/01/21 09:12 to 09:23, Checking sitemap
Hey! 48 found urls!  
But they aren't listed on coverage. Maybe best to wait some more. 

## 26/01/21 09:23 to 09:40, 
Having some small thinking about markdown images now that I know some vimscript. 

Steps are: 
* Take the image
* Copy the image to a local folder and insert the text. 
* Really what I want is an abrevation that let's me grab a filetype 

I [asked a question on vim stack exchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/28906/how-do-i-get-filename-completion-to-ignore-a-leading), and the reply was broadly "no", but pointed out some options in Jekyll

Vim issue  was fixed later when tidying up. 


## 26/01/21 09:44 to 10:08, Emails, including time playing with thunderbird.
* [Here's the list of of shortcuts](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts) 
* The reason there was a problem with sending mail was that I hadn't opened the 'sent mail' folder on gmail.  I imagine it will work on my laptop again now.  
	* Update, it's going to be annoying syncing the settings between devices. 



## 26/01/21 10:08 to 11:30, +EQT emails
I lost some content from yesterday, this is best guess for +EQT emails (I definitely had a break in the middle)


## 27/01/21 07:38 to 08:00, Been sorting out signitures FOR 20 MINUTES! 
## 27/01/21 08:02 to 08:15, Personal Emails now. 

## 27/01/21 08:15 to 09:17, +EQT emails now 
A lot of that was on the Google Ads. 
And the rest of was writing follow up emails from the Crucible.

## 27/01/21 13:21 to 13:51, Tidying this file 
...and checking sitemap
* Checking Sitemap, we've gone up to 29 valid files. (but there are 38 posts so...)* Ah, it lists 20 files that have been discovered and are waiting to be indexed. That's a start.   
* Also Reviewed the inserting of images into this file. I've updated the approach and I'm happy with it. Got it closer to 2 minutes, which still feels very long. 



## 27/01/21 13:52 to 14:25, I want to think more about this inserting of images idea. 
I think I've solved the 'write markdown to insert the image' problem, but I don't believe I've fixed the 'get file into the right place, ideally without a mouse' problem. 

This was interesting to build. I couldn't get it to call the function I'd created (although I could get the function to run independently) 

	:command! -nargs=+ -complete=file Joe Insertimage(<f-args>) 


I think the most simple way will be to drag and use the abbreviation. Let it bed in. 

## 27/01/21 14:28, In any case, I should probably do some light blogging. 



## 28/01/21 05:46 to 05:56, faffing for 10 minutes
## 28/01/21 05:57 to 05:58, Time to look at the actions from last week. +EQT 
Turns out I'm on top of that one.

## 06/02/21 13:41 to 14:01, Intergrating Watson into homepage
* First action is to learn about submodules
	* Commiting the main (super) project, says "The superproject is linked to the current commit of the subproject" so when updating, you pull the subproject, then commit the superproject.
	* It is possible to merge files back in and preserve history

	Git 2.23 (Q3 2019): if you want to clone and update the submodules to their latest revision:

	git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules

	If you just want to clone them at their recorded SHA1:

	git clone --recurse-submodules


	git submodule init
	git submodule update
* I checked watson online - there was nothing to push
* I added the submodule to my homepage with the following command
     git submodule add -b dr_wat https://github.com/joereddington/watson/ diary/watson

* I ran ./watson ../index.md and it failed. 
* I ran tests, they worked, I created a new one for index.md 
* As a distraction, I found out that I could make tag files with 

    ctags *.py

* I cut down the example, and wrote some simplifying test cases. 
* While simplifying I came accross another simple error - the Entry class didn't check it was being passed a string. I fixed it, and created a test to check. 
   * In the process, I learned the python for testing an exception is thrown. 
* Oddly, I couldn't get the bug to trigger when I imported the code directly. 
Well that's strange, it works fine when I don't use get content... 
* I continued drilling down, I found some print statements that suggested I'd tried this before. 
* I tried altering the function, but other tests failed (this was the second time other tests had caught a problem), eventually I made the constructor ensure that there was always a valid for entry.end 
* I (finally) managed a sucessful rebase - by putting the reword at the top and the squashes below it. 
* After all that, the code is working as I hoped it already was.

## 12/02/21 07:28 to 08:07, Fixing joereddington.github.io
That was interesting. 
* It's still unclear where the error was, I think it might have been a combination of a problem with a missing image in index.md and a seperate problem with the submodule I added. 
* I used the "git revert HEAD" command to 'reverse' the last commit (it appends an extra on on the end) and later I used the command "git revert X" to reverse only commit X. That was awesome. 
* In the end I created a new main branch with only the commits on it that I liked. That was fun. 
* I used the "git cherry-pick c096635" command, which let me grab a single commit from another branch and bang it on the end
* I'd be willing to try the submodule again. 

## 12/02/21 08:14 to 08:22, 
* I thought this was interesting:  https://www.matuzo.at/blog/testing-with-tab/ in the context of keyboard only usage of websites.   
I've generally been faffing though. It's really time for some good gratitude posting!

## 29/01/21 08:17, Accounts section
* 171 pages? That's cool. I really though we'd drop 20 in this process.  I'm up to 111 of this review as well (although I think there is a lot more work now) 
* Fixed an early bug  
* I've fixed the next table Now I need another one beause I have to do the major system THING  
* We'll do the index when we come to that bit of the pdf 

- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  generate the major system keywords for the accounts and keep writing  


## 29/01/21 14:17 to 15:21, More book. 
Started by dealing with the footnotes
We're accdientally 175 pages! 
Now to commit


## 29/01/21 19:39 to 20:18, Back again.  
- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  Rewriting the Accounts example from the start. 
* Going to go through looking for caption/lable order problems 
* Also going through looking for undefined references 
* In future will need to sort citations.
* Back to rewriting. 


## 29/01/21 20:32 to 21:17,Book  
* I'm rewriting the accounts example 
* The class examples need two clear blank lines between them 
* Something has gone wrong with spelling :( 
- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  do work on summary, need to make sure those bits are in the main chapter

## 30/01/21 12:53 to 13:24, Book. Working on summary  
Working on the bullet point lines. I decided to go with all captials, all full stops (unless they are sentence fragments or word lists and to hell with the colon for the start
\(^.\{12}\d\d:\d\d\).*, is apparently the search I'm using but I think it's 

/\\item.*[^.]$ to find all the lines without full stops.  

## 30/01/21 14:56 to 15:41, Book again
* Done the bullets 
* Completed classes entirely 
* Rewrote the start of Trees 

We should note - there might be so much to rewrite from this point forward that it would be worth doing another simplewriter from the Trees Chapter onwards.

## 30/01/21 19:33, Back again

## 30/01/21 19:34, Oh wow - I wrote most of the tree chapter before the class chapter and it really shows. I've changed a lot of the terms and methods. 

## 30/01/21 19:51, I think I need to build this example properly. 

## 30/01/21 20:00, Okay, it's very simple to do with with three people per node, and then having external links. 


But it's two people per node. 

I need each of the people to be linked to a country, and be linked to another countiry. 

## 30/01/21 20:01, Let's do it myself. 

Couples. No, film antagonists. I have them murder a character from a previosu film 

France beat croatia \link Da Vinci Code, tom hanks is made of bagets and the monk is very proud of his cravat 

## 31/01/21 13:04 to 14:29, I'm back. Let's try this from the top. 
* Learning about Cntl-O in vim insert mode, it's quite the key saver
* Started a major rewrite, almost from scratch, of the first example in the tree chapter. I feel like I'm going to be here for a while.  

I think I want a bit of a break, but what's the next action. 

Next action is start again with the wriing at line 2010. This one is a slog.  


## 01/02/21 06:50, 
Ten thousand facebook hits feels like a lot. A lot.  

## 01/02/21 07:17 to 08:01, Delores
* Now doing the notebooks and the reminders
* Hey, found some urgent STUFF. 
* Now notebook, which was empty. Cool 

## 01/02/21 08:12 to 11:34, today I'd like to do a 'washington run through' which means I touch every time before I stop at... 11:30.  
* Didn't manage it, but did a really solid morning of ticking bits off. Lots got moved forward, lots got done, lots of STUFF got dumped. 



## 12/02/21 20:38 to 21:23, Memory book. 
It's been almost two weeks since I worked on this. Going to have to probably start from the start of the tree chapter again

Just rewriting from the start 

## 12/02/21 21:23, 
This chapter is hard. Make it more honest: 
I don't use this for family trees, and I suggest you don't because I don't know which of these are siblings, but I can make a point about balanced trees.  
  

## 16/02/21 08:01 to 08:50, Email day!

## 19/02/21 05:13 to 05:28, Clearing out Personal Inbox 
## 19/02/21 05:28 to 05:57, Now clearing out work inbox. 

## 19/02/21 05:57 to 06:30, working on this file. 
Which involved: 
* Deciding to write a blog post 
  * Wanting to change the colours on an ssh 
    * Downloading a new terminal app. 
Sigh. 

## 19/02/21 08:22 to 08:55, Live working on memory book book.
I believe I've solved the first example.  
I'm still missing a couple of good examples, particularly around sorting. I might do years.  
Years of books?  Create a tree with the years that fictional books are set in. What is the point? Simple to construct, relatively easy to write out a list of 'nearby' dates (split long books into several parts)
* Disadvantaces (hard to search by film, hard to check something is already in (no it isn't!)   
* Oh, means that you can keep adding questions. 
* Walking the path is good context. 
* Can include biographies, films, and some history books. 
Yes, I think this might be a goer. 

I've done the big thinking. 
I want an example that is 'years of historical fiction books' 
I want an example that is 'inventions arranged in a tree' (subclasses still work) 

That gives me two more examples for a: 

* Introduction example 
* Sorting example
	* Invention sorting example. 
* Decision Tree example 

That's probably enough. 




## 19/02/21 10:19 to 10:27, Clearing up my git repos
* You can use 'git stash clear' to clear stashes  
* I've also been setting upstreams and STUFFj k:w
* Okay, the git is all nicely organised, that's nice. 

I would be nice to do some Mouse Sniper work. That starts by putting the mouse in the box and finding the first THING I have a problem with. 


## 19/02/21 10:35 to 11:12, (E) Write a python script for 'commands in this time window'

* Converted to python3
* SE pointed out that I should read the .bash_history rather than the output of the history command.  
* Had the wrong branch for a while and tests were failing.
This might be a nice way of doing this. 

## 19/02/21 14:10 to 14:59, Working on the new watson 
I've discovered the annoying fact that this WON'T work on public because I didn't set up the history problems 

## 20/02/21 16:14 to 16:26, Working on vim command history

## 21/02/21 06:38 to 07:12, I'm working on the vim command history
Commands of interest:
21/02/21 06:48, python3 command_list.py "## 21/02/21 06:37 to 07:32,  Worki"
21/02/21 06:51, vim command_list.py

Actions: 
* I've updated the local vim to match master and added a missing plugin
* I've added the ability to be called from the command line to python
* I've run HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T " and that appeared to have had an effect on the laptop. 
* I've found out that history doesn't include repeated commands 
* I used  r !python3 git/watson/command_list.py "## 21/02/21 06:37 to 07:32,  Worki" which worked from the command line. 
* I've found out that the ": is the expression register
* I've written the lnc command which inserts the commands relabily, but it's using hardcoded data (and currently whipes the clipboard.


## 21/02/21 07:13 to 07:21, Updating this file

## 28/02/21 07:31 to 08:26, Flowers for Turing site. +EQT
I was happy to find that I'd already made a site, also that some of the images weren't on the wordpress site at all - they were linking to old images from my CS website- that would have been sad to lose. 

I installed Jekyll from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ - it gets easier every time.

I decided to make the existing content into blog posts. They are events that happen on a date.  I moved over the 2013 post (which is probably the longest and most complicated) and the FAQ 


Started using some cool commands to copy accross images 

wget -i `wget -qO- http://www.flowersforturing.equalitytime.co.uk/?page_id=3903 | sed -n '/<img/s/.*src="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | awk '{gsub("thumb-350-", "");print}'`

That one was quite cool, I'll be using that again for the other pages.   

It needs maybe another hour, two, to move accross the rest of the pages and so on. Then I ask for proofreadin.


## 01/03/21 07:30 to 08:15, Tidying this file. 
So much faff, using tools that are actually meant to help. 

## 01/03/21 08:15, Okay, MAYBE now we can get started?

The problem was that the plugin used to generate the pages isn't gituhb friendly, so I'm building locally and pushing the site in the docs directory. 

I fixed the issues with the pages and improved the css. There is more to do but I'm happy with it.  


## 01/03/21 14:08 to 14:25, Start of stream again (D Google Ads Volunteer) 30 Write a supertitle landing page @eqt 
So the problem with this is that a supertitle landing page means that the project page gets broken up. 

There's some other problems with the project page: 
* White Water Writers doesn't have posts listed with it. 
* I think this boils down to 'implement the issues raised by the google ad words people.

For the blog: 
* It's nice to do everything monthly. Reconcile with the bank, put up all the payments, check (and chase) all the invoices. 
* We've now got a paypal account, which I'm nervous about because PayPal doens't allow multiple approval, but it was the only way to take in bills.

* Traced various payments right through the system. It was quite fun. Although I did have to look in Quickbooks, unity, Dropbox, Google Drive and Gmail.

1 post in Charity CEos 
A review of the vegan group
A review of the charity group
Replying to all the comments 
Working through the feed -

I've set up the situation for the trees - It took a while. And there will be quite a few more hours involved. 

## 04/03/21 21:39 to 22:00, Working on website +EQT

## 05/03/21 07:13, Rewriting this file 
I should ask myself how many monthly visitors is worth me learning how Google Analytics works. A hundred a month? 

Well, I'm getting 100 a day. So that's quite a lot, but I'm looking at the THINGs we're spending our google ad money on and it's hardly the right targeting

I mean, I really want it the other way around - I want to get, say, 10 emails a week, and have the conversation work.  

## 05/03/21 07:29, A 100 a day is enough. I'll need to get my analytics perfect.  

## 05/03/21 07:31, Okay, I really would have liked to have written a blog so that I felt like I'd had a really good morning. But that can wait for today.

* Okay, that's that done then. Hmm. Nothing to scheule or anything. Got my book to focus on from now




## 08/03/21 07:04 to 07:18, Clearing up. 
* I think mouse sniper might NOT be workign because of the permissions on iterm
  * Hmm, definately still works from terminals. I suspect restarting will fix it, but that can happen next time
* Todo is up to date

## 08/03/21 07:18 to 07:26, (A) 1. Looking for urgent: Check Calendar and reminders and notebooks  @singleton +PlanningAndTracking Time:20
Calendar is fine. 
* Reminders.




## 08/03/21 07:26 to 07:32, (A) Check Mozfest Schedule

## 08/03/21 07:32 to 09:15, (B) Work on: https://github.com/joereddington/Projects-Public/issues/35 +PersonalProjects
Okay, well this is a THING that I really don't actually want to do, so I should do it.
* The next action is to create the tree of the sorted books.
* Well I'm definately filling up pages. 
* May as well create the balanced tree before I go 
* Okay now done? Is there one more THING I can quickly sort? Maybe finnish the in-order traveral? Oh go on.  
* Quite pleased with this as a sprint.

## 08/03/21 09:21 to 09:26, (C Kat) Pick some sessions on https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/schedule
* Okay, I keep just opening it and that is it.  

## 08/03/21 09:26 to 09:46, Just going through tasks now
Done to 70. 


## 08/03/21 09:46 to 10:36, Social Media Processing
* Tweetdeck firs
* Facebook was the rest. Mostly comments and then a lot of time trying to make sure that I've sucked every morcel of interet dry.  Need to be blogging first. Not as fun this way.  


## 08/03/21 20:01 to 20:45, Mozfest session

## 09/03/21 06:30 to 06:45, Email 
* Mostly attempting to delete a lot of mail

## 09/03/21 06:45 to 08:32, Work email +EQT
* Including sorting out a 'begining balance off' issue in quickbooks
* Putting invoices into banking
* And fixing some other invoices
* Now minutes

## 09/03/21 08:32 to 11:13, Analytics course +EQT
I went right through the Google Analytics for Beginners course at https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/ 
* I'm now happy with Goals and setting up funnels. Also the connection of search consoles and Google Ad accounts
* I like that I can annotate traffic
* I like that I can now make links a lot more trackable with the URL builder  https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/ 
* I know a bit more about my own webpages - suprised by some THINGs. 
  * My personal blog has a massive bounce rate. Massive. 
* I have big plans to test a lot of this STUFF in anger on the FFT website
* I think the next step is really that I do some work on the websites themselfs: 
   * Adding calls to action and clear paths through on landing pages and popular ones.
   * Fix the mobile usability on the EQT site
   * OVF is getting traffic oganically quite well, we should look into why and why 
* But there are direct analytics things to build
   * Make sure that outbound links are tracked on the EQT website
   * Set up a funnel for the OVF site to show how effective it is being.  (including how many of them are sucessful) 

Got a certificate https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/certificate/LO54niEeTgqoX1Asax0ARA 

## 09/03/21 11:17 to 11:40, Okay, social media processing 

## 09/03/21 15:25 to 15:41, Stack


## 09/03/21 15:42 to 16:30,(A) Mother's day card(S)
Turning into game of house of books 

## 09/03/21 16:34, Okay, that was good, that was a nice long sprint. Turned it around a bit there. What can I do with the last 25 minutes? 

## 09/03/21 16:34 to 17:00, Flowers for Turing sites. +EQT
* The Repo: https://github.com/eQualityTime/FlowersForTuring/
* The github site: https://equalitytime.github.io/FlowersForTuring/
* The main site: www.flowersforturing.equalitytime.co.uk/
* I've cloned, and I'm running the bundle
* But apparently I have to install some? What's this nonsense...?  

* Thought I had a solution with the multiple index files, but no
* Removed some spare images from the root
* Trying the /docs method
## 09/03/21 17:00, All the images are saved in the 2014 folder and I've created the post - I only need to put the page through the converter



## 09/03/21 19:45 to 20:33, More on Turing Site +EQT
* The text is in, now for the photos, although I want to really get the hang of the sizing
* I'm sizing solely by html

Okay, I've added, and commited, and I've got a bunch more posts to move accross. 
I'm a bit suprised to find out that the general level of quality of the site is very poor. There are missing receipts and missing thank you and a wide range of other errors. Very poor.  

Okay, it should be relatively simple to move the rest of the pages over. Some are very small indeed.   

It was only 15 mintues to move the 2015 page, and probably could have been much faster.
2016 will be quite long, 2017 will be near trivial 

Lots of things to do once I've moved the posts over: 
* Set up the paypal pool 
* Set up the google analytics 
* Rewrite the site to have a clear funnel
  * What we do
  * What happens to the money
  * The order form/form if you'd like some news
* Throw all the google ads money at it. 




## 10/03/21 07:30 to 08:12, +EQT web work
* Updated a theme for EQT site
* Ordered a backup from dreamhost
* editing the trustee page 
* Fixed the Flowers for Turing upload issue

##TODOs 
* Get a mobile theme for eQuality Time site
* Put self on the staff page

FFT
* Test theme on mobile
* Fix all the images
* Transport the rest of the pages
* Add GA code 
* Ask for design input
* Work out what you want from a funnel 
* So I'm looking at https://www.gosh.org/donate-our-appeal/ - and one THING that's clear there is that donation is a seperate page.  Click to donate, and then, 'how much would you like to donate?' and then gift aid 
* Oh, hey, we have a proper pay pal THING now, we can accept money in any amount... 

## 10/03/21 08:26 to 08:41, Okay social time. 
Going 

We're redoing our home office, and I really really want to build it around a massive bit of reclaimed wood as 

## 10/03/21 08:41, I mean, is that going to be it... 

* Could do with the photo of french toast on vegans of luton, but that can wait right. 
* Also the streaming. 
* Also the inbox


## 10/03/21 10:18, (A) Send Yvonne an invoice for influencer times @private
£200 is a start 

## 11/03/21 06:28 to 07:38, Attempting to reduce bounce rate on personal site
I'm going to take a moment to work on my personal site
I want to reduce bounce rate. Which is currently... 79.87% over 30 days  

The big landing pages and their bounce rates are. 

* Homepage 68%
* Disability on facebook 74%
* diswiki 76% 
* Animaated pdfs 90% 

Two of those are on the old site and badly need a full rewrite, so I'll create a task for them, and put calls to action in the others. 

In an effort to track outbound links I also discovered that some sites already do (joereddington.com) but some don't (eqt, which I think I've fixed, and joereddington.github.io, which I hope I've fixed but only for one link) 

I spent some time finding out about google tag manager, which it turns out I don't need. 
I also discovered there are a bunch of different 'versions' of google analytics and I am unhelpfully using a mix across sites



## 11/03/21 07:38, Big THINGs for the day
* Run, big run
* Facebook processing - big one. Ducks 
* Accounts 
* Working on todo list 

## 11/03/21 07:41 to 07:43, (A) Send Yvonne an invoice for influencer times @private
I've built it. 


## 11/03/21 07:55 to 08:41, Sorting out Yvonne's Accounts

I'm quite pleased with that. I have some questions to ask her but we're good. 


## 11/03/21 08:59 to 10:21, Fake news meeting +EQT



## 15/03/21 05:44 to 08:45, Putting todos in order.  
As an exercise, I tried to do _something_ useful to all 90 tasks on my todo list within three hours. I *just* made it. 

After three hours there are 33 left. Mostly this is me taking out ones that have already been done, or needed rewriting, some of it is me sorting out very quick tasks and moving forward on them.   Certainly there was a lot of doing 'small tasks that I've been avoiding' and I feel good about that.

The remaining tasks are all ones where I definately know the next action and I'm pleased to think that I can do them. 

Something that became quite obvious as I went through: I'm really negleting a project-level view, and that's not ideal at all. I'd like to be much more *there*

* Found that both the greek version and the vannila version get the same error. 
* Reminded myself that the code isn't properly under version control (turns out I was wrong) 
* Reminded myself that the website is also NOT properly under version control. 

While attempting to tidy up I got the error: 

> "fatal: could not create work tree dir 'temp': Disk quota exceeded"

so I deleted like 26 gigs of stuff. Unhelpfully that included the actual code. 
* Yak Shaving: 
   * Applied for the microsoft non-profits work 
   * Fixed the company number on the file. 
* While clearing space I accidentally deleted the code. 
  * There is okay code in the repo, but it's missing some updates (particularly hooking into the ovfplayer
  * Main one was reconnecting the ovfplayer code to the main system, which I did. 
  * Even with the old code, the greek still doesn't work
  * Took the opportunity to keep the code and the designs in separate folders and made some commits on that basis. 
		* Cleaned up the designs folder more afterwards
  * Rewrote upload.php which the idea that it might take a CSS file
    * Found out that the CSS file I wanted wasn't any good. (replaced it with one from WWW) 
* Found that there is a live version of the OVF site on github pages: http://equalitytime.github.io/TheOpenVoiceFactory/upload_board.html and attempted to get that working. 
  * Used a couple of rounds of opendiff to compare with the server one.
  * Deleted the old site. 
  * Lots of potential projects with the analytics now. 
* Moved on to the bug
  * Found out I can't run localcreate at testing.* (eventually solved this by moving to python3
    > ImportError: No module named lxml 
  * Ran it on local machine
  * Got the classic error that we expected: 
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-3: ordinal not in range(128)
  * Wrote up the notes. 
  * Did some print statements (probably should be using a debugger by now (was doing this much more properly by the end of the bug)
  * Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOb7OUM0OGU in the hope that it will help. 
  * Did lots of googling decode and encode. I think I've got it. 


## 07/06/21 16:15 to 16:36, Back and doing the processsing  +EQT
* Looking at the unicode issue 
	* Wow, we don't use 'decode' anywhere in the text. 
	* The encodes appear to be used in the right places. 
	* I've fixed the existing bug by putting a 'u' in the right place. That was good. That was from the vide. 
	* Decided to write some proper tests of the language. 
* Another error: 'toppage' is hardcoded (this turned out to have been fixed in a parrelle commit, and then needed fixing again later)


## 07/06/21 19:44 to 21:11, Back to it +EQT
* discovered that 'master' is the wrong branch:  
> This branch is 4 commits ahead, 9 commits behind production.
	* I've reviewed, and, other than some tweaks I've replicated. This is the only one that matters.  https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/commit/e80123869ea1a909d668e6bdba935e9007292a92. Right now I've got to concentrate on getting this working, and then doing the 'from scratch' version. 
* Unicode
	* I've got a file with some tests for encode/decode. I certainly understand it more. But NOT completely. 
	* The main problem is that I'm converting filenames to ascii so I've got 100 greek filenames that convert to ""
	* I wrote a test to show I could write a file with a unicode name
	* So I've taken the encodes out...  You get some fucking great names of boards. 
* Two debugging tricks in Python: 
	* Adding -i (so python -i) drops you in the interpreter when the programm terminates
	* Adding the following code drops you into the interpret when you want
		import code
		code.interact(local=locals()) 
		* Pressing control-d runs the script again. That's cool 
		* From https://code-maven.com/switch-to-interactive-mode-from-python-script 


## 08/06/21 06:31 to 07:41, Code again +EQT 
* Everything now writes in unicode
	* I found a way of getting the test to work by using a different library
	* The manifest is now writing much more nicely, but NOT entirely. 
	* I've found a way (using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18337407/saving-utf-8-texts-with-json-dumps-as-utf8-not-as-u-escape-sequence) to get the json to dump unicode

Everything appears to be running. Let's test it... 
	* Ha! The code isn't being run on the server
	* Turns out that this was hidden because (due to the recovery yesterday) I'm NOT using the times as the scramble
	* The issue is the config - python wants the lxml library and I can't work out how to install it. 

## 08/06/21 07:41 to 10:39, Converting it to python3 and deploying . +EQT 
There's an issue with Dreamhost config- we can't install a particular library for 2.7.  Also, we're starting to really suffer from the fact that this is writen in 2.7, which is pretty old and it's hard to google for things.  So I'm taking a break to see how easy it is to upgrade. It turns out it was relatively simple but we have an issue with col row. 
* Converting to python 3
	* Used 2to3 -w to start with 
	* Had to convert a bunch of pixel sizes to ints (which is fair) 
	* Had an issue with x and y's being too large so added an exception and a warning
	* It ran quite quickly
	* But 7 tests failing. 
	* I checked out if python2.7 was failing the tests as well because I hadn't checked them since the unicode changes.
		* No, only failing two of them - arabic and slovakain. 
	* First test to look at is the colour one, looks a lot like the col and row issue is to blamej
	* I built a massive test by outputting the funciton results in 2.7 and copied it over. 
	* Ended up being really hacky and using // as the operator rather than properly rebuilding the method (it works though) 

* I've pushed it to server. 
	* Now getting can't find pptx. 
		* I literally JUST  copied the files 
	* It runs! 
	* Okay moment of truth, lets try it online. 
	* Not working. Not telling us why NOT working either. Just NOT working. 
* So, now the problem is "Getting the error messages working again. 
	* Did it: needs tidying
* Okay, so now I've ended up with a problem in the obz. The ovfplayer isn't accepting the toppage address. 
	* Issue was a typo in the manifest. 
* It works, I've emailed people. Pushed a commit.

The White Water Writers website now has reasonable analytics and it's getting some hits from Google Ads.  But those hits are not converting, partly they are aimed badly. 

All of the adds need to be aimed at the homepage, and then a funnel will take them through to the contact us page. 
  * To do this right, I need to properly understand the ads. 
Then I need to rebuild the site with a funnel and some A/B testing.

* Writing up to start with. 

* Started working on the finance section because I thought it would be easier
  * It's difficult, because I have to go through the budget in detail and add a lot more information, including three quotes from everybody. 
  * I've done the management question, but now I do the proper budget 
  * I did some reading around and found that there were more prompts available https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Unsuccessful_GFTA_applications_over_15000_Oct_2016.pdf 
  * I considered taking the contingency for unexpected costs out of the budget but decided against it as nobody had complained. 
  * The management question is done, but long, it will get cut down in simplewriter. 
  * Need to be sending this to reviewer at 3pm. 
  * Looked properly at the things that the reviewers say that look at and it's a really mixed bag so I have to put everything in.  
  * Did an experiment - it turns out the description in the budget table can take at least 2000 characters, which means that's where I've got to fully describe what is happening in really solid detail 
  * Finding multiple quotes for venue hire and things

I'm having an OVF day. 
* Created an issue from the email 
* Create a test file and documented it more nicely in the issue - along with links and so on. 
* Checked in with https://www.openboardformat.org/docs It looks like the first part of the problem (the display bit) is as simple as using 'vocalisation' rather than label.  

## 21/09/21 07:29 to 07:54, OVF regression tests +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/issues/136
Before properly working on the bug I'd like to take the opportunity to fix the regression tests.  
* Currently 4 tests are failing and 1 has an error. The error definitely needs to be fixed. 
* Took a long time to fix test_create_obf_object but it's fine.  
* Decided it would be good to have a script that generated the regressions, and then found that some genius had already written one. 

## 21/09/21 08:00 to 09:50, Children and school run 

## 21/09/21 09:51 to 12:13, Regression tests +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/issues/136
* I upgraded generate_regressions.py to python3 and fixed a bug 
* The failing arabic test was a real bug from upgrading the main code to python 3 - turns out you CAN'T implicity cast exceptions to string any more. 
* I've updated the regressions and carefully committed THINGs 
* I've upgraded generate regressions again so that it works for both directories. (there were two files) 
* I've put all the testing files in the tests directly, and improved some of the rest of the structure. 
* After a lot of effort we now run tests with 

> python3 -m unittest

* Learned about and implemented subtests 

## 21/09/21 12:13 to 13:06, let's lok at ovfplayer +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/issues/136

## 21/09/21 13:06 to 14:58, https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/issues/136 Back on the main bug +EQT

* Don't need phone 
* Encourages simplicity - no carbs 
* Just a list. 
* Easy entry. 
* Computer is where I do a reasonable amount of my eating
* Lists over a week. 
* Copy-paste for repeated meals. 
* Can do while working. 

Let's give it a go. Tracking is going to be useful. It will be a bit tricky at weekends, but even if it's only tracking on weekdays, it's pretty good.

## 24/09/21 05:07 to 06:08, Let's look at that bug.  +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/issues/136 
* Don't know how to test for it but let's have a look. 
* I mean, one problem is that we export the images as a side effect... 
* Moved that, got 6 errors(!) 
* crap, it's because you have to label the images first
* Okay, so an easy way to do this is fine the damn image
  * Done. Now let's look at the code 
* Reversing it made a tiny difference, but hardly proper. 
* Um, I think I did it, even if I don't understand the code... t 

* I did some more refactoring, but it's hardly amazing stuff. 
* Running tests and getting ready to push 
* Oh wow, closed issue with commit message! 
* And it's live! Testing now.

Found three of them in the branches of communikate - I forgot I did that. And it's a better place for them to be really. But I'm putting them in the regression tests because I want some more regression tests and I want them in the same place.  

## 28/09/21 13:37 to 14:24, Press release?  +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/Public/issues/124
I'm failing at this, how would I write it for reddit. 


We hired influencers to help teenagers make resources about fake profiles on social media and they've had great results. 

Three groups of students in different schools interviewed a set of influencers on private zoom calls and used that content as the basis for creating resources for other students.  

Those resources were given to the rest of the schools and, when we tested everybody, we found that their ability to critically evaluate the content they see on the internet went up improved nicely. 

It boils down to "Teenagers are probably not going to listen to parents or teachers about social media, so let's meet them where they are because they *are* going to listen to influencers".  There's lots of nice comments on <a href=http://www.projectreal.co.uk/>projectreal.co.uk</a>.

* Notably, you always review safeguarding policy after a serious incident. 
* I'm unclear if our policy properly lays out how we would handle an safeguarding issue, other than 'deal with it sensitively.'
* "Have clear policies on bullying and harassment, and whistleblowing", um, we don't have those, but we don't really have enough staff at this point. 
* Notably, we don't do due dilligence with people, because we assume that our clients (schools, univerisities, prisions) have need of much more rigorous standards than we require, but we don't officially say that
* "All charities must prevent abuse for extremist purposes.", "must be part of your charity’s risk assessments, policies and procedures."  We need an anti terror strategy?

## 05/10/21 13:02 to 14:41, Tidying up and pushing and updating OVF site +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
* My changes broke the regression tests.
* I've updated them, and changed how they are done so it's easier to compare them in the future. 
* I've commented out the other test that was failing because it relates to a abandoned feature 
* Checked the changes to the pageset online 
* This  git merge --squash <feature branch> (::git) turned out to be a really good way of making a faffy commit structure look much nicer. I like it and I want to use it again.  
* Updated the OVF site with the changes 


## 05/10/21 14:41 to 14:47, Writing up notes +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
My day so far has involved two big coding projects, although neither were high priority they are both nice to have done. 

## 05/10/21 14:47, Now time for a transition. Email? Delores?

* The last couple of days have been brilliant for putting hours in, but they haven't really focused on anything in my long term plans have they? 
* Reviewing previous dates - I think that the automatic timesheet update has made this a bit better, but I should update that. 
  * Some small updates to the annual leave calculator


## 05/10/21 15:50 to 16:23, (A) Check actions from last meeting +EQT
...and writing up a starting point. 

What is a volunteer and what isn't. 

We define a volunteer in terms of responsibility and access.  A bystander who helps us arrange tables before an event isn't a volunteer, nor is someone who contributes to our open source projects.  However someone who arranges the flowers for Flowers For Turing, or runs a white water writers camp certainly is.   The difference in these cases is that the volunteer has been given some level of responsibility (which could be physical, financial or relate to information) - specifically someone is an eQuality Time Volunteer if we delegate some of the organisations own responsibility to them.

## 06/10/21 14:15 to 14:32, I've been writing up the VA THING +EQT
But I'm starting to think about doing this automatically. 

I've got a set of folders. 
I want a loop that goes through the folders and pulls down every single info file. 
And then for every file it names it with the slug and extracts the title and the name of school. 

That sounds like it would take me an hour and remove a lot of work for the VA. (later: three hours at least)

## 12/10/21 15:28 to 15:36, New branch  +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
I've realised that I need to do refactoring to get the tests to work!  
* Here's the problem - my write_to_obf file expects three different subfolders, and the paths are really inconsistent about what writes to where.

Used ng serve in anger for the first time

## 12/10/21 20:00 to 20:57, Had a meeting  +EQT


## 13/10/21 06:27 to 07:59, Right let's get back to that code +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
* I want to do a big overhaul of the code, but I don't want to break anything
* I have regression tests, but only for the json output - not the obz, and the obz is a big part of this. 
* SE recommends that I hash the obz files and compare, but that's going to take ages. However, it's also a good start
  * I can add more complex testing once this is done. 
* However, to produce decent hashing, I have to refactor! because the code requires a silly and complex file structure to exist.  
* So I'm very carefully doing the first refactor to allow regression tests for a proper refacor
  * Changed 'icons' to 'images' so everything was in the right directory' 
  * Made sure that the directory was only hardcoded in one place. 
  * Created a hash file function

## 13/10/21 09:42 to 10:31, Hello +EQT  https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
* Found a genuine annoying bug about commas in special commands
  * The issue is that one can have place(", this") but my code things that's a subcommand, sigh.   
  * I should write a proper test - it's the right thing to do and would a fuckton faster
  * Once I started writing tests I found a bunch of edge cases I never coded for. so now six tests don't work. 
  * Okay we are on regressiontestsinobf and we would like to merge *only* bff2fe1ac4790d7026eb28ce85a08a4d490eaee7 (and for the hell of it, 7652c849a315f8a6bd9f4cec9d77c0b140db6288 ) 
  * Oh wow! It worked a lot better when I chose the right commits! 

## 13/10/21 10:31 to 11:28, Yet another new branch +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
Now we've written the tests, we open yet another branch (from main) to fix them. 
* Fixed some tests with basic changes. 
* Tried csv for a while until I realised that csv wants the quote *directly* after the delimiater), 
* we know the delimiter will be ")\s," so I put it in a regualar expression
* Merged (with squash, because I got careless) into master, all tests passing
* Then patched into the current branch - and as the interent warned me, some of the cherry picked branches appear more than once... 

## 13/10/21 11:29 to 12:29, back to the obf regression +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
* Yeah, this is a screwed up log file 
* Failing 10 tests, but that means that the process command ones are owrking
* Running generate regressions again. (I stopped earlier because of the process coammands bug)  
* I can generate them 
* I'm now running a test to test them, but I think it's slow. 
  * Taking 30 seconds to run fail first one. :(  probably ended up as a five minute test suite. That's definitely too long  
* Er, I'm getting a different hash every time... 
  * Is it because of the ordering? No - it's always the same first file... o
* let's try something else - there's 411 boards in the damn folder now. So why not work through them.  
* Find the files and compare the json 
  * Trying that now... 
  * Making an alteration to see if ther is a fail.  
  * There was a fail - but it was two minutes for two files! 
  * Damnit - it's NOT going to work! The files are over the top of each other! 
    * Like, it will work with exactly one pptx 

## 13/10/21 12:29 to 13:31, back to the drawing board.  +EQT https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/ 
What's the best way of doing this? 
* Get generate to write the output to invidivual directories. 
* Tests take 247/259 seconds - that's far too long but it's what I have 
* I've added to the main approach and I've rebased so that the history is reasonably clean. 

I should remember that I've made a fair amount of progress in this sprint
* Localcreate is better
* Handling of special commands is better
* internal handling of Where Files Are is better
* Regression tests exist
 
However, I now need a break - overall I don't think I'll be continuing with the interupted refactoring branch - it will be easier to rerefactor (and add proper tests as THINGs arrive) from here. 

## 13/10/21 13:31 to 14:10, +EQT adding todos for refactoring - mostly to grid and pageset https://github.com/eQualityTime/TheOpenVoiceFactory/

## 13/10/21 15:24 to 16:26, I think I'm going to build a funding bid engine +EQT late:https://github.com/eQualityTime/Public/issues/136
* Wow - it was 40 minutes to simply copy accross all the questions! How many are there? 
  * There are 46 individual questions to write up. That's incredible. 
  * Like, that's 10,000 words of answers to come up with.  

Do we think I could do it in a day? With this new approach?  

Currently I have 3,700 words, and I think we might be copy pasting some others.

* Another 15 minutes and I found I was getting into it. 

## 14/10/21 06:39 to 07:57, +EQT working on https://github.com/equalitytime/public/issues/100 
* One annoyance is that when split questions I have to go back to the original document and split there. There's probably a better way to do that  
  Later: It was a little confusion putting the texts in, but I imagine will get better. (Hopefully) 
* I want to update the css - it looks fugly 
* fixed a typo on the Flowers For Turing Page (I was looking up better css)

* Got as far as the classes example, which suggests I'm halfway though. It's going quite well. 
* Taking a small break to sort out margins 
  * Evening them up added four pages? 
  * Yeah, it makes the book narrower. That means another review. sigh. But I like it more

## 08/11/21 21:00 to 21:28, Tidying up this file +EQT
So, what do we know about Delores? 
* It Went quite well. 
  * Would have been good to remember the 'all work is emotional' 
  * Would have been great to do the kitchen tidying, food, and morning approaches
  * Made a really nice dent into the main projects. Did important things  
    * There's something to be said for 'really' big problems right? Like, MAYBE  Delores should be divided by the size of project: 

<2 JUST  do 
=20 quick note about what I'm doing 
=60 Notes on commands and websites used for later
>120 Blog post and detailed readme file.  Closing issues, that sort of thing. 

The eight hour days have made me much more interested in attacking the really really big projects. 

* Arguably - one should just start and set a timer (or pay attention to a log - if you go over an hour on a single sitting of the project, you then rewrite the issue (or write the issue) and start again. When you reach three hours, then you write the blog post. 

* To be fair. The loss of time today was about phone calls, Nova, and other childcare. I was pretty on it. Delores helps me a) clear our lots of little bits on reminders and b) concentrate on important tasks for a while.  

There are actually only for (C) tasks left, but two of them are 'half-days' and the other two are probably an hour long. After that I suspect I'd make a lot of mess of the (D) tasks.  Hmmm. 

Let's say that I (found the mouse) and created the teacher spreadsheet in half an hour and then the code in an hour and then another hour in sending the emails. That's doable before the kids get up right? Then I get to play with the server all day right?

* It's going to be an AWS day

So what's the first page I want to server on the AWS? 

None of the github ones. 
* Which suggests I want a script. 
* The ones that definately have to be there evenautlla are:
  * WWW 
    * Watchtower
    * Oracle 
  * OVF 
  * Supertitle


And everything else arrives on github happily. 

But If I'm doing web, then I should definitely start by sprucing up the three websites that are already efficient.  

* Sorting out the GA, funnel and Award on the Open Voice Factory
* A/B Testing on the Project Real site
* Review of the White Water Writers site 

So these: 


(E) Upgrade OVF to GA4 on: https://github.com/eQualityTime/Public/issues/119 +EQT   XX
(E) 10 Add the Nominet prize to the OVF website  XX
(D) A/B test on the Project Real site on: https://github.com/eQualityTime/Public/issues/120 +EQT XX

sudo yum install -y nginx php-fpm works for the php but NOT the nginx? 

5 Google for nginx and jekyll (or try this: https://gist.github.com/rickharrison/6410194 )

Okay, solid day really. What's next?  

* AWS: sort out priorities. 

What do I want most? 
* Be off dreamhost
* Etherpad working 
* WWW working 
* OVF moved

It's pretty obvious to me that the key thing is to move OVF. Both the main code and the designs. I don't think I need to move the site at this point, but IDK.  

Once the OVF site is moved, I think I can close dreamhost entirely. 

There's some writing up to do for WWW I think. and indeed some reading.

## 15/12/21 11:17 to 12:29, Working on automatic notes from history +EQT
I've been working on my history input.  

The main public one wasn't working, It's still not working. It needs to be more fully deployed as a github page. I put the first parts of it together at https://joereddington.github.io/export-history/, which is a win.  

Seperately I improved the import to this file via 'lnh' - that was cool.  I added a blacklists as well as whitelist (lnh is blacklist, public is whitelist).   

When reviewing it became clear how rarely I am fully present in the work, how much room there is to grow, and how often I turn to the internet rather than simply thinking, solving the problem on my own, and reading man pages and help files, my books and notes. 

* Investigate getting crontab online

    * Discovered that the OVF site takes about ten seconds for the main page though... 
  * pulled on server - had to sudo su first. 
* For Flowers For turing 
  * Reduced the size of the main image for page loading.

Three things to do and I think I can definitely do them.

## 04/02/22 13:57 to 14:10, Writing this blog: https://equalitytime.co.uk/6600/2022/02/04/fail/ +EQT

## 04/02/22 14:10 to 14:21, (E) File the documents in the inbox.  +EQT
Done! We are done! Whole list. 

## 04/02/22 14:21 to 15:17, Working on Delores +EQT
* Highlighting is now on every page 
* In general, I feel like Delores should have more lines on fewer pages, and possibly only a new page if there is a threashold size of process >20 
* Thinking about it. The idea is that we 'do Delores until we find we want to stray from it' and then rebuild or reassure'. 
* At the moment the tendency is for me to start ignoring it once we move onto the list, which is fair enough because there is a transition between getting set up and getting stuck in. 
  * But, part of the point of delores is 'how do we do this perfectly?' how do we make sure that: 
    * that projects are really properly broken down, 
    * next actions list is genuinely in the right order. 
    * That code is properly reviewed and committed. 
    * That I really do work from the top to the bottom and grind though to a point where I am waiting on other people. 
  * However, let's NOT forget that in the last few months I've made great, near amazing strides forward:
    * Eight hour days are normal. 
    * I've zeroed the next actions list four weeks running (twice this week) 
* In general the big things to improve on Delores (and by extension, life) are:
   * None work days: running, kitchen cleaning, housework, night time 
   * Emails better (in terms of length, blogs, if/then/else
   * better social media integration in general 
   * literal paperwork. 
   * Personal todo list. 
   * Personal inboxes
   * Fridge and thus food management 
   * output to paper checklists

Other things we learned today. 
  * We could do with a real written definition of 'done' on some of the tasks, or at least, a more project level view. I've put in a note to review the github issue as part of this.  
  * the 10minute watching timer is a great way to pull you out of flow (although, hopefully also, back into flow) - a couple of times today it interrupted me when I was working well.  
  * It *is* possible to do the priority list in order. And it's also possible to feel the pull of 'how about I keep working on this'.  
  * People you respect aren't 'constantly on' they are doing the work. 

* Another thought - the focus on 'productivity' is great, but it's NOT as great as 'focus on results' - and it would be so good if we could look back at the last week and read a bunch of really great blogs we did. 

## 04/02/22 15:17 to 15:31, Igor reviewing  +EQT
* Can you believe it was only 33? Almost none of the events.csv were relevant
